# Restaurant Reviews App
---

## Description

Project created as part of Front-End Nanodegree Program

### About Project

I was provided the starter code for restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device.

The task:
1. Make the project responsive.
2. Include standard accessibility features
3. Register Service Worker to make the app work offline.


### How to run the App?

1. Download the repository.

2. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some  simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

3. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

4. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` with your favorite browser.
